# Katana Editor

It was part of something i was working on in the past and was totally inspired from Medium.com's editor.
Lot of codebase from [Yabwe editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) and Danke Editor(_cant find it anymore_) was used in the first version. Editor default theme is also inspired from Medium only(big fan).

But this was few years ago, Trying to put it out now as still good medium style editors are missing from the web(maybe i should search more).

## Features include
1. Basic formatting options
2. Uploading image/video/embeds(using embedly)
3. Image grids
4. Parallax effect with background images.
5. Support for user to leave notes.
6. Partial save for content
7. Read, Edit, Write and publication modes

## Build
use `grunt` to make dev builds, and `public/index.html` to preview the file.


## Upcoming updates
1. Making codebase clearner and atleast ES6 compliant(its not right now)
2. More modular codebase
3. More examples
4. Themes support

## Important
Icon set is custom, but you are free to use, if you like it.
I don't mean to infringe any other project if they use the name *katana*. 

## How to Contribute
New to public projects, so all suggestions are welcome.
